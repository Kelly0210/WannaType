    `Four-bedroom farmhouse in the countryside. All of the four double bedrooms
     are en suite with luxury shower and bath. Farm kitchen with barbecue, tables
     and chairs outside. Great for groups of friends. The supermarket is half an hour
     by car and you can take a train from the village into the city. Escape from
     normal life for a few days as we have… NO INTERNET and you can only use
     mobile phones at the bottom of the garden!`,

    `Greenland is a huge island in the far, far north of the world. The weather there is very harsh
     and cold. Even the 'hottest' summer day on Greenland is like a cool winter's day in England.
     In the summer months, the sun never sets; it is light all through the night. The warmest part
     of the island is on the south coast and that is where most Greenlanders live. However, it is
     still a very hard place to live because of the cold.`,

    `Architecture involves using the most basic of design concepts and mixing them up in a way that
     not only serves an artistic purpose but is also functional. We have built skyscrapers touching heights
     beyond our wildest imaginations. All of it wouldn't have been possible without an architect who thought
     of the impossible and had innovative ideas to make use of every piece of technology at their disposal to make it happen.`,

    `A giant, colorful canyon bakes under a hot sun in Arizona. Carved over
     millions of years by the Colorado River that flows through it's base, the
     Grand Canyon is up to 6,000 feet deep (meaning that in some places,
     it's big enough to fit 19 Statues of Liberty stacked on top of each
     other!) The floor of the canyon has a diverse landscape, featuring
     dried up desert areas that can heat up to 120F as well as forests
     where temperatures sometimes drop to minus 20F.`,

    `Lakes vary greatly in size. Some measure only a few square meters
     and are small enough to fit in your backyard. Such small lakes are
     often referred to as ponds. Other lakes are so big that they are called
     seas. The Caspian Sea, in Europe and Asia, is the world’s largest lake,
     with an area of more than 370,000 square kilometers (143,000 square miles).`
